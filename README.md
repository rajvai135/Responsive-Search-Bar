# Responsive-Search-Bar
This project creates a responsive search bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The search bar adjusts to different screen sizes and filters a list of items in real-time as the user types. It uses simple JavaScript to match the input text with list items, showing only the relevant results.
